                <p>Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy. And maybe a little bush lives there. It is a lot of fun. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Only eight colors that you need. Let's do that again. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Here we're limited by the time we have.</p>

                <p>When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Maybe there's a little something happening right here. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. We can fix anything.</p>

                <p>If you hypnotize it, it will go away. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Look around, look at what we have. Beauty is everywhere, you only have to look to see it. Let's put a touch more of the magic here. Life is too short to be alone, too precious. Share it with a friend. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy.</p>
