        <div class="wrapper">
            <div class="nav">
                <p>this div has a fixed position</p>
            </div>
            <div class="positioning">
                <h1>Position</h1>
                <p>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an elemnet.  The four position values are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fixed:</b> this will pin something to a spot, and it will stay there as you scroll. <em>(ex: nav bar)</em> Fixed position takes elemnts out of the normal document flow.</li>
                    <li><b>Static:</b> this is the default setting, it is not affected by top, bottom, left, and right properties.  It is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page.</li>
                    <li><b>Relative:</b> does not take the element out of normal document flow.  Still appears within its space/div/container, but allows it to be offset a bit from the top, bottom, right, left.  Top, right, bottom, and left properties will move it away from its normal position.  Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.  *If <em>postion: relative</em> is set but no other positioning attribute (such as top, bottom, left, right), it will not affect the position at all and treat it as static.</li>
                    <li><b>Absolute:</b> takes element out of the normal document flow.  If a parent element position is set to relative, and the child element is set to absolute, the child element's new (0,0) coordinate will be the upper left hand corner of the parent element instead of the whole page.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The <b>z-index</b> property allows you to override the normal stacking order of the page.  The default z-index is 0, and you can set that value to be positive or negative.  An element with a greater z-index will stack in front of an element with a lower z-index.  If two elemnts have the same z-index, or don't have one assigned, the elemnet positioned last in the HTML will show on top.  You must have a position assigned in order to assign a z-index.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="lotsoftext">
                <h2>Here is some text, so you can scroll and see the div with a fixed position example:</h2>
                <p>Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. This is the way you take out your flustrations. This is your world. It just happens - whether or not you worried about it or tried to plan it. Let that brush dance around there and play. We'll put a happy little sky in here. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. We need dark in order to show light. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. In your world you can create anything you desire. The least little bit can do so much.</p>

<p>Here we're limited by the time we have. Trees grow in all kinds of ways. They're not all perfectly straight. Not every limb is perfect. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. Fluff that up. Just a little indication. Let's have a nice tree right here. Let the paint work. It's amazing what you can do with a little love in your heart. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen. The first step to doing anything is to believe you can do it. See it finished in your mind before you ever start.</p>

<p>Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. You can get away with a lot. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow. Here's another little happy bush Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Be brave. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. Let's do that again. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world.</p>

<p>Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things If you overwork it you become a cloud killer. There's nothing worse than a cloud killer. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. You can do anything your heart can imagine. Get tough with it, get strong. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Now we can begin working on lots of happy little things. You're meant to have fun in life. Everyone needs a friend. Friends are the most valuable things in the world. You can spend all day playing with mountains. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let all these things just sort of happen. Now then, let's play. As trees get older they lose their chlorophyll. We spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned. And maybe a little bush lives there. Let's make a nice big leafy tree.</p>
