// 1: Here we require the use of the express npm package that we've installed in our dependencies.

// 2: We create an instance of express. We're actually firing off a top-level express() function, a function exported by the Express module. This allows us to create an Express app.

// 3: app.listen will use express to start a UNIX socket and listen for connections on the given path. This method is identical to Nodeâ€™s http.Server.listen().

// 4: The given path is localhost:3000.

// 5: We call a callback function when the connection happens with a simple console.log.

// 6: We import the route object that we just created and store it in a variable called test.

// 7: We call app.use and in the first parameter create a base url called /test. So our base url will look like this:   http://localhost:3000/test

// 9: For our second parameter for the use() function, we pass in test. This means that all routes created in the testcontroller.js file will be sub-routes. It will look like this:  http://localhost:3000/test or http://localhost:3000/test/

// 10: Created a sequelize variable that imports the db file.onTable

// 11: use the variable and call ".sync()".  This will ensure that all we sync all defineed models to the DB.
