You then fill in the missing pieces with words of your choice in a way that the completed sentence makes sense.','Consider this sentence - "It was really <strong>____</strong>, and we <strong>____</strong> ourselves <strong>____</strong>". This sentence has three missing pieces- an adjective, a verb and an adverb, and we can add words of our choice to complete it. We can then assign the completed sentence to a variable as follows:','<blockquote>var sentence = "It was really" + "hot" + ", and we" + "laughed" + "ourselves" + "silly.";</blockquote>',"<hr>","In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.","You will need to use the string concatenation operator <code>+</code> to build a new string, using the provided variables: <code>myNoun</code>, <code>myAdjective</code>, <code>myVerb</code>, and <code>myAdverb</code>. You will then assign the formed string to the <code>result</code> variable.","You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words.
